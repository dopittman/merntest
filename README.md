# MERN Test

### What is this?
This is a small project I am using to help get familiar and test new methodoligies with setting up a full-stack application with the MERN stack.

This is just for my personal use and can(and mose likely will) have broken code and UI across the app.

### Notes
- Node/Express (index.js) needs an active (Tenor) API Key to make API calls. I have deactivated the former one as it was for testing purpose only. Otherwise the 'Gif Test' will not function.
